QUESTION - 1 :

Problem Description
Due to pollution Delhi government has applied odd even rule in Delhi.
Traffic police on guard is recording the registration number of vehicles passing through his area and storing the last digit of the number in an array A.
You are given the array A and date of the day B. Also fine for breaking the rule is C Rs.
Find the total fine in Rs collected by the traffic police.

Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 105
1 <= B <= 31
1 <= C <= 1000

Input Format
First arguement is an integer array A.
Second argument is an integer B.
Third argument is an integer C.

Output Format
Return an integer.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = [1, 2, 3],B = 31,C = 100
Input 2:
A = [0, 1, 1],B = 2,C = 51

Example Output
Output 1:100
Output 2:102

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Vehicle 2 is not following the rule so only he will be fined.
Explanation 2:
Vehicle 2 and 3 are not following the rule so both of them will be fined.

Solution : 
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : integer
    # @param C : integer
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A, B, C):
        s = []
        if B % 2 == 0:
            for i in range(len(A)):
                if A[i] in [2,4,6,8,0]:
                    s.append(0)
                else:
                    s.append(1)
        else:
            for i in range(len(A)):
                if A[i] in [1,3,5,7,9]:
                    s.append(0)
                else:
                    s.append(1)
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == 1:
                count = count + 1
        if count == 0:
            return 0
        return C*count
            


Question - 2:

Problem Description
Given a string A, find the frequency of all the characters in it.
Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 105
Ai = {Lowercase latin alphabets}

Input Format
Given a string A.
Output Format
Return an integer array of length 26.
Array should contain frequency of characters in increasing order of characters.
Example Input
Input 1:
A = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Input 2:
A = "interviewbit"

Example Output
Output 1:
{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
Output 2:
{0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0}

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Every charcater is present once in the string.
Explanation 2:
'b' is at indices 10.
'e' is at indices 4, 8
'i' is at indices 1, 7, 11
'n' is at indices 2
'r' is at indices 5
't' is at indices 3, 12
'v' is at indices 6
'w' is at indices 9
Rest of the characters are not present in the string


SOLUTION:
class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):
        freq = {}
        for char in A:
            if char in freq:
                freq[char] += 1
            else:
                freq[char] = 1
        
        result = []
        for i in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
            char = chr(i)
            if char in freq:
                result.append(freq[char])
            else:
                result.append(0)
        
        return result
